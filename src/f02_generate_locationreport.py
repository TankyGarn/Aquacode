# *** File purpose ***#
"""
Aim:
The aim for this file is to be able to make a location report that 
creates a plot of lice over the history of the location.

How achived:
*Write functions that make it posible to generate alot of reports, per location.

What to improve:
*Would like to use this to generate a location report in Pdf form where we could
combine different plots like these to create a location report, whom utilizes 
the location reports that are in the sedimentation dataset.

    This function splits the dataframe into a dataframe that folows one location.

    NAN objects in list means there has not been any counting of sealice.


    Args:
        dataframe (dataframe): needs a dataframe with the correct identification value as a column
        location (int): should be a location id number
        identificaiton (str, optional): _description_. Defaults to "location_number", this exists
